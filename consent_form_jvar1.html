    <h1 style='margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;text-align:left;'>HIT name: How variable is this group of items?</h1>
    <!-- I need to use div tag option to selectively change css properties in each section-->
    <p style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:1em;"> This is a consent form. You can start the HIT by pressing the <i>Agree and Continue</i> button below on this page.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"> Task instructions and practice trials will be provided on the next page.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:left;"><u>1. Purpose</u></h2>
        <p style="margin-top:0;text-align:left;">This is a study about estimating the variability of items having various colors and orientations.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:left;"><u>2. Duration and Procedure</u></h2>
    <!--  CSS should be created to make it square-like structure  -->
        <p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;text-align:left;">
            130 Americans who have a normal or corrected-to-normal vision of 0.8 or higher within 6 months and normal color vision, 
            speaking English as a native language, and with age 18 and over will be recruited.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:left;">
            In this study, you will be asked to watch a group of items having various orientations and colors,
            and to judge how variable this group of items. The HIT takes about 20 minutes. 
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:left;">
            Before starting the main trials, there will be a familiarization phase which will take about a minute. 
            During this period, several example items will be presented sequentially. There will be no task that required to do, 
            and you can just watch example items. The purpose of the familiarization phase is to provide you an overall sense of the items 
            that will be presented in the main trials. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">
            After the familiarization phase, the main trials will begin with a few practice trials. In each trial, 
            you will be asked to watch a group of items having various orientations and colors. You will be asked to judge how variable this group of items. 
            You can judge that items with similar colors and orientations are less variable, and items with dissimilar colors and orientations are more variable. 
            To report the variability of items, you can adjust the slider bar shown below the items. Please adjust the bar on the slider toward right if you feel that 
            the variability of items appears large, and adjust it toward left if you feel that their variability appears low. There is no time limit to report. 
            If you finish the adjustment of the slider bar, click the continue button below the slider to proceed to the next trials. 
            During the HIT, you may feel that your eyes are tired because of attending to displays. In this case, you can rest as much as you want 
            before moving onto the next trial by not starting the next trial.
        </p>
